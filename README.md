##### Description :
  * ###### This project aims to create your own custom images using Docker on Virtual Machine and build a simple website using these images. The project should be able to successfully install Docker images and the complete application, including the docker-compose.yml file. This project aims to extend the knowledge of system administration by applying the concepts of using Docker. Additionally, you can also refer to the documentation I have prepared above to understand unlearned concepts that may arise during the project.
